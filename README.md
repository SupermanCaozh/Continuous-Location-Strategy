# Continuous-Location-Strategy
A Static Continuous Location Strategy based on Multi Intelligent Agent-Optimization Algorithm
An automatic location algorithm based on swarm intelligence algorithm has been proposed to tackle the location problem in a continuous real space and is validated on a case give in [1]. 

## Highlights of this work
1. We design a novel objective function for general location problems which takes both of the branch operation costs and residentsâ€™ travel costs into consideration simultaneously.
2. A comprehensive location strategy which combines hierarchical clustering and multi gravities methods.
3. A swarm intelligence-based continuous location algorithm is proposed and shows outstanding results.

The *heuristic.py* contains the swarm intelligence-based location algorithm. The *present_cost.py* contains the novel objective function proposed. The *run.py* implements the innovated strategies and outputs the simulation results with hyper-parameters given in the case in [1].
